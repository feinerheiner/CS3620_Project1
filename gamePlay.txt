Welcome to Zombie Run. The point of the game is to make it out of the building. You will be faced with
questions. Your choices will impact the outcome of the game. 
Choose wisely.

You find yourself in an empty room with 3 doors one to the left, right, and directly in front of you.
Choose which door to go through.(Left/Front/Right)
You open the door to a bathroom. You hear a wet dripping sound. A Zombie jumps out of the stall
and bites your neck.You did not escape.
